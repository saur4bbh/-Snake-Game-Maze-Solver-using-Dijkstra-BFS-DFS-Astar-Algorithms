# -Snake-Game-Maze-Solver-using-Dijkstra-BFS-DFS-Astar-Algorithms
This project implements an intelligent Snake game where the snake autonomously searches for and reaches the maze’s goal while avoiding walls and obstacles. The pathfinding behavior is powered by classical graph search algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A*, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
